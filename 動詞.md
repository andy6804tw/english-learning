## 動詞句型
其實英文裡的助動詞很多種, 提幾種最常見的

1. do/does : 一般動詞於否定句, 疑問句用, 後面加動詞原形, do/does 的過去式為did

ex. Do you like apples? No, I do. (簡答時用或

No, I don’t like apples.

2. can/ may/ will/ shall + 動詞原形(情狀助動詞)

We will be there. 我們會到的. (表未來動作)

3. 以上四者的過去式 could/ might/ would/ should + 動詞原形

ex. I could do that. (表過去可以做到, 可能性較can小)

We would do that. (表過去可能會做某事)

You should do it. (表應該去做...)

4. must + 動詞原形 必須做...

ex. He must stay home. 他必須待在家

5. 因為 must 無過去及未來式, 因此用have to

這裡的have/has/had 是輔助於完成式, 也是助動詞, 但不能接動詞原形.
