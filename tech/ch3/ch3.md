## 3-2 主詞動詞一致
### 搭配單數動詞
#### 1. one of + 複數名詞
One of my favorite films is Pretty Woman.

```
「很多部電影」→ 複數名詞 films
描述「《麻雀變鳳凰》」是其中一個 → 用單數動詞 is
```

#### 2. neither of + 複數名詞 
Neither of her parents is attending the parent-teacher conference this year.


> 「兩者之間都沒有」，要用「neither of」；而要表示「三者以上之中都沒有」

#### 3. none of + 複數名詞
None of the rooms is available for rent right now.

#### 4. each + 單數名詞
Each one of them is excited to go to the amusement park.

### 動詞要和較接近動詞的主詞一致
#### 1. not only A but also B + 動詞
Not only you but also I am responsible for this project.

#### 2. either A or B + 動詞
Either you or she is lying.

#### 3. neither A nor B + 動詞
Neither your email nor your texts make any sense.

### 動詞要和較遠離動詞的主詞一致
#### 1. A, as well as B, + 動詞
`Chocolate`, as well as roses, is a good choice.

## 測驗
```
1. Neither Jessica nor I _____ to play basketball.

2. Cindy, as well as her parents, ______ going to Japan for Christmas.
```

```
1. like
→ 接近動詞的主詞是 I，因此要搭配原形動詞 like。

2. is
→ 主要主詞是 Cindy，所以要搭配用 is。
