## Abstract

```
To our knowledge, the patch learning idea has not appeared in the literature before, ant it opens up a promising new line of research in machine learning.
據我們所知，PL的想法到目前為止還沒有在文獻中出現過，而且他在機器學習的研究展開了一個新的希望。

```
The aim of this paper is to propose a novel architecture called Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System.
本篇論文的目的是提出一個新穎的架構，叫做基於自適應網絡的模糊推理系統。
```

## Introduction
```
By contrast, a fuzzy inference system employing fuzzy if-then rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge.
反之，模糊推論系統採用模糊邏輯判斷規則，可以對人類的知識進行質性方面的建模。
```

```
However, training a high performance machine learning model is usually a challenging.
然而，訓練一個高性能的機器學習模型通常是一個挑戰。

```
In particular, processing type-2 fuzzy set (T2FS) is more demanding than type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS) and even the concept of T2FS is more complex than T1FS. 
尤其處理第二類型模糊集合比第一類型模糊集合要求更高，甚至第二類型模糊集合的概念也比第一類型模糊集合更複雜。
```

```
Both types of fuzzy if-then rules have been used extensively in both modeling and control.
兩種類型的模糊邏輯規則已經在建模和控制中被廣泛地使用
```

```
The idea of PL may be intuitively understood by the following example.
藉由以下的例子可以很直觀地了解PL的概念

```
An adaptive network  is a multi-layer feedforward network in which each node performs a particular function on incoming signals.
自適應網路是一個多層的前潰網路，其中每個節點在輸入信號執行特定的功能。
```

```
There have been different strategies to enhance the performance of an under-performing machine learning model.
有多種不同的策略可以提高表現不佳的機器學習模型的性能
```

# Result
```
Due to the adaptive capability of fuzzy inference system, its applications to adaptive control and learning control are immediate.
由於模糊推論系統的自適應能力，在自適應控制和學習控制中的應用是即時的。
```

```
It goes without saying that the nonlinear ANFIS outperforms the linear AR model.
```

```
Fuzzy control is by far the most successful applications of the fuzzy set theory and fuzzy inference systems.
到目前為止模糊控制是模糊集理論和模糊推理系統最成功的應用。
