## Abstract

```
To our knowledge, the patch learning idea has not appeared in the literature before, ant it opens up a promising new line of research in machine learning.
據我們所知，PL的想法到目前為止還沒有在文獻中出現過，而且他在機器學習的研究展開了一個新的希望。

The aim of this paper is to propose a novel architecture called Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System.
本篇論文的目的是提出一個新穎的架構，叫做基於自適應網絡的模糊推理系統。
```

## Introduction
```
By contrast, a fuzzy inference system employing fuzzy if-then rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge.
相較之下，模糊推論系統採用模糊邏輯判斷規則，可以對人類的知識進行質性方面的建模。

However, training a high performance machine learning model is usually a challenging.
然而，訓練一個高性能的機器學習模型通常是一個挑戰。
