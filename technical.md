## Abstract

```
To our knowledge, the patch learning idea has not appeared in the literature before, ant it opens up a promising new line of research in machine learning.
據我們所知，PL的想法到目前為止還沒有在文獻中出現過，而且他在機器學習的研究展開了一個新的希望。

```
The aim of this paper is to propose a novel architecture called Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System.
本篇論文的目的是提出一個新穎的架構，叫做基於自適應網絡的模糊推理系統。
```

## Introduction
```
By contrast, a fuzzy inference system employing fuzzy if-then rules can model the qualitative aspects of human knowledge.
反之，模糊推論系統採用模糊邏輯判斷規則，可以對人類的知識進行質性方面的建模。

```
However, training a high performance machine learning model is usually a challenging.
然而，訓練一個高性能的機器學習模型通常是一個挑戰。

```
In particular, processing type-2 fuzzy set (T2FS) is more demanding than type-1 fuzzy set (T1FS) and even the concept of T2FS is more complex than T1FS. 
尤其處理第二類型模糊集合比第一類型模糊集合要求更高，甚至第二類型模糊集合的概念也比第一類型模糊集合更複雜。
```

```
Both types of fuzzy if-then rules have been used extensively in both modeling and control.
兩種類型的模糊邏輯規則已經在建模和控制中被廣泛地使用
```

```
The idea of PL may be intuitively understood by the following example.
藉由以下的例子可以很直觀地了解PL的概念
